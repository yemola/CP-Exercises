          I created the table below. I used pseudo-class selectors to highlight
          the odd rows

          <table>
            <thead class="colored">
              <tr>
                <th>Country</th>
                <th>OrderID</th>
                <th>Order Amount</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>USA</td>
                <td>1000</td>
                <td>$1,300</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>USA</td>
                <td>1001</td>
                <td>$700</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>CA</td>
                <td>1002</td>
                <td>$2,000</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>CA</td>
                <td>1003</td>
                <td>$1,000</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
            <tfoot class="colored">
              <tr>
                <th>Total</th>
                <th></th>
                <th>$5,000</th>
              </tr>
            </tfoot>
          </table>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Background color of the heading cells: <strong>#427fef</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Background color of odd rows: <strong>#eef7ff</strong></li>
            <li>Border color: <strong>#c4dcf3</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can find the solution in the zip file attached to this lesson in
            the table folder.

          I created the box shown below.
          <div class="box">
            <p class="experience">
              <span>W</span>hile preaching to a man at his workplace, we noticed
              that he paid rapt attention. After the brief discussion, he
              promised to visit us at our accommodation after his close of work.
              And to our surprise, he kept his word. He said that he would like
              to express his feelings about our preaching work. He said that it
              is high time we built a branch (kingdom Hall) in Arokho. He feels
              that each time a group visits, they stir in them a yearning for
              God’s word. And when they leave, it’s like they leave them
              starving. “Please beg the people who sent you here to bring a
              branch (Kingdom Hall) to this village.” he pleaded. We commended
              him for his sincere personal interest and appreciation, and
              assured him that we would inform our branch of his wish. We also
              encourage him to continue to study the Bible with the Witnesses,
              to which he agreed.
